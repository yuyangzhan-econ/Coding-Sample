## 1. Overview

This package contains Stata code samples from a part-time research assistant coding test I completed as part of an application process. The code demonstrates my proficiency in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and econometric methods using Stata.

## 2. Confidentiality Notice

Due to confidentiality requirements imposed by the supervising professor, I am unable to provide specific information about the research project's content, data sources, or substantive findings. The code provided here has been anonymized to protect proprietary information while preserving the technical aspects that demonstrate my coding capabilities.

## 3. Code Interpretation

Throughout the code files, you will notice comments marked with `[Data Deleted]` or similar annotations. These indicate locations where I have removed or anonymized specific content to comply with confidentiality agreements. Despite these redactions, the code structure, programming logic, and technical implementation remain intact and representative of my actual work.

## 4. What This Sample Demonstrates

Even with the necessary anonymization, this code sample effectively illustrates:

- My ability to write clean, well-commented Stata code
- Proficiency in data cleaning
- Understanding of econometric methods and their implementation
- Problem-solving approach and coding logic
- Attention to reproducibility and code organization

## 5. Note

I am happy to discuss the technical aspects of this code and my approach to solving the problems presented in the assessment during an interview, within the bounds of the confidentiality agreement.
